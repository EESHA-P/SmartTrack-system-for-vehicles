# SmartTrack: Intelligent Vehicle Tracking & Monitoring System

## Problem Statement

Modern transportation faces critical challenges such as vehicle theft, poor fleet management, and delayed emergency response due to a lack of real-time tracking. Existing vehicle tracking systems are limited in scope — they often do not support:

- Integrated accident detection
- Driver behavior analysis
- IoT-based analytics
- Real-time vehicle health diagnostics

These limitations result in financial losses, increased safety risks, and operational inefficiencies. Additionally, the absence of OBD-II integration prevents early detection of mechanical failures, leading to costly breakdowns and unplanned downtime.

## Solution: SmartTrack

**SmartTrack** is a smart vehicle tracking system that combines IoT, OBD-II data, and analytics to offer:

- Real-time location tracking
- Accident and incident detection
- Driver behavior monitoring
- Vehicle health diagnostics via OBD-II
- Predictive maintenance alerts

By leveraging IoT and smart analytics, SmartTrack enhances fleet efficiency, improves safety, reduces maintenance costs, and extends the lifespan of vehicles.
